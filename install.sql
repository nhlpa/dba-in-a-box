	This script checks the health of your SQL Server and gives you a prioritized
	to-do list of the most urgent things you should consider fixing.

	To learn more, visit http://FirstResponderKit.org where you can download new
	versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
	the findings, contribute your own code, and more.

	Known limitations of this version:
	 - Only Microsoft-supported versions of SQL Server. Sorry, 2005 and 2000.
	 - If a database name has a question mark in it, some tests will fail. Gotta
	   love that unsupported sp_MSforeachdb.
	 - If you have offline databases, sp_Blitz fails the first time you run it,
	   but does work the second time. (Hoo, boy, this will be fun to debug.)
      - @OutputServerName will output QueryPlans as NVARCHAR(MAX) since Microsoft
	    has refused to support XML columns in Linked Server queries. The bug is now
		16 years old! *~ \o/ ~*

	Unknown limitations of this version:
	 - None.  (If we knew them, they would be known. Duh.)

     Changes - for the full list of improvements and fixes in this version, see:
     https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit/

	Parameter explanations:

	@CheckUserDatabaseObjects	1=review user databases for triggers, heaps, etc. Takes more time for more databases and objects.
	@CheckServerInfo			1=show server info like CPUs, memory, virtualization
	@CheckProcedureCache		1=top 20-50 resource-intensive cache plans and analyze them for common performance issues.
	@OutputProcedureCache		1=output the top 20-50 resource-intensive plans even if they did not trigger an alarm
	@CheckProcedureCacheFilter	''CPU'' | ''Reads'' | ''Duration'' | ''ExecCount''
	@OutputType					''TABLE''=table | ''COUNT''=row with number found | ''MARKDOWN''=bulleted list | ''SCHEMA''=version and field list | ''NONE'' = none
	@IgnorePrioritiesBelow		50=ignore priorities below 50
	@IgnorePrioritiesAbove		50=ignore priorities above 50
	For the rest of the parameters, see https://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz/documentation for details.

This script displays your most resource-intensive queries from the plan cache,
and points to ways you can tune these queries to make them faster.


To learn more, visit http://FirstResponderKit.org where you can download new
versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, contribute your own code, and more.

Known limitations of this version:
 - This query will not run on SQL Server 2005.
 - SQL Server 2008 and 2008R2 have a bug in trigger stats, so that output is
   excluded by default.
 - @IgnoreQueryHashes and @OnlyQueryHashes require a CSV list of hashes
   with no spaces between the hash values.
 - @OutputServerName is not functional yet.

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - May or may not be vulnerable to the wick effect.

Changes - for the full list of improvements and fixes in this version, see:

This script analyzes the design and performance of your indexes.

To learn more, visit http://FirstResponderKit.org where you can download new
versions for free, watch training videos on how it works, get more info on
the findings, contribute your own code, and more.

Known limitations of this version:
 - Only Microsoft-supported versions of SQL Server. Sorry, 2005 and 2000.
 - The @OutputDatabaseName parameters are not functional yet. To check the
   status of this enhancement request, visit:
   https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit/issues/221
 - Does not analyze columnstore, spatial, XML, or full text indexes. If you
   would like to contribute code to analyze those, head over to Github and
   check out the issues list: http://FirstResponderKit.org
 - Index create statements are just to give you a rough idea of the syntax. It includes filters and fillfactor.
 --        Example 1: index creates use ONLINE=? instead of ONLINE=ON / ONLINE=OFF. This is because it is important 
           for the user to understand if it is going to be offline and not just run a script.
 --        Example 2: they do not include all the options the index may have been created with (padding, compression
           filegroup/partition scheme etc.)
 --        (The compression and filegroup index create syntax is not trivial because it is set at the partition 
           level and is not trivial to code.)
 - Does not advise you about data modeling for clustered indexes and primary keys (primarily looks for signs of insanity.)

Unknown limitations of this version:
 - We knew them once, but we forgot.

Changes - for the full list of improvements and fixes in this version, see:
